# Project Name: Edu Station

Live site link: [https://edu-station-209b8.web.app/](https://edu-station-209b8.web.app/).

## Project Description:

* We use react js, react bootstrap, react router and firebase to implement this website, and we install react router dom and rechart.

* This is a single page project, as we use react router, it fells a smooth transaction between traversal of the website.

* The purpose of this eLearning platform is that it creates a robust learning experience that feels like a classroom experience, offering the traditional classroom characteristics (like instructor-student interaction, Q&As, discussion, games, collaborative projects, quizzes, etc.)
